 * What is a Docker Image?
 *
 * From Docker's documentation:
 * A container image is a standardized package that includes all of the files, binaries,
 * libraries, and configurations to run a container.
 *
 * But as a "super basic description", we can explain it as a "frozen" instance
 * of a computer.
 * 
 * How do we build them?
 *
 * > Shows DockerFile example code
 *
 * Docker has its own language to "express" a set of commands that "defines"
 * what will contain our image. The process of running this commands and getting
 * a "image" is called "build"
 *
 * > Fade the code
 * > Show a "flow diagram" with, "DockerFile" -> "Build" -> "Image".
 *
 * > Fade the diagram / Show the code again
 * > Display a "block" at the right of the code representing our image content.
 *
 * > Iterate over the code to explain how each line adds a customization layer
 *   to our image.
